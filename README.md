## Introduction

VBase Frontend/Backend is a codebase for collecting the data to store it in a KYVE storage pool. The spec includes Javascript, TypeScript, React, NextJS, and PostgreSQL. 

With the frontend interface users will be able to sign the proposal vote with their Keplr wallet, and with the backend `api/read_review` the data will be stored in the storage pool. It can be also used as a basic backend API.
